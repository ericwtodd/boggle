A Boggle Solving Pipeline using a Deep Learning Model &amp; Computer Vision 

This repository includes a project (code & writeup) that I worked on to solve the game Boggle. I used computer vision techniques to segment a picture of a boggle board, and isolate each letter on the board.
I then trained a deep convolutional neural network to recognize letters from the game boggle, make sure to account for noise & rotation.

I built a pipeline to accept an image and output the predicted board, and the all the words available for the given board. 
Though my model achieved around 98% prediction accuracy I still have some work to do to make sure it doesn't mistake any letters at all, but it was a fun project and helped me solidify concepts I have learned of deep learning and computer vision.
